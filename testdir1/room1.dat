You are standing in room 1. It's a square room with a door in each 
wall.  There is a painting on the southern wall. The light is coming 
from overhead and shines gently from a chandelier.

Will need to add things to this so that the file will be able to pull
exits out, then reference the appropriate filename based on which 
exit was chosen. Also need to be able to list the "items" that are 
in the room. 

It would also be useful to add more detail commands such as "examine"
or "look".  Look would redisplay the room-text from the file and 
"examine" would be able to have an argument passed (argument would
have to be one of the nouns from the room text). If the argument isn't
valid then the examine return would be "You don't see 'xxx' here."
